# Movie-Review-Sentiment-Analysis
The data of user reviews about the movies are given. 
The ground truth about the review (whether itâ€™s talking positive, negative or neutral about the movie) is not available. 
Based on the above information and data, the engine that can predict the sentiment of the statement/review is to be designed. 
Given below are some of the pointers to solve this problem.

a. Since there is no ground truth, you must create one. Remember that creating ground truth is a manual task. 
  i. You can create a dictionary of positive/negative words and use scoring approach to tag 
  ii. You may start with obtaining word frequencies in creating the dictionary as a start 
  iii. You may use Data mining techniques to dynamically identify the ground truth from web pages. 
b. Once the ground truth is prepared, use ML approach for predicting the sentiment of review. 
c. How many classes for the target you think is appropriate?. This changes with respect to the use case.
